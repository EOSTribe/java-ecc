# ECC Cryptographic module for EOS chain

This ECC model is refactored out from original sources for EOS Commander:

https://github.com/playerone-id/EosCommander 
  
Our thanks go to PlayerOne for developing it. See License notice below.


### Build
On the console type:

	After checkout run: 'gradle jar' to build jar library of the sources.

And that's it. No glory here - just a Java library with ECC cryptographic module and nothing else.
It can be used as dependency in Java projects to performa encryption/decryption and digital signatures.
